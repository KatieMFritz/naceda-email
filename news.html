              <h3>Senate Expected to Resume Negotiations on HUD Funding; December 11 Deadline Looms</h3>
                <p>After one day of debate on the Senate's FY 2016 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) appropriations bill, it was withdrawn on November 19 because of a controversial amendment relating to refugees that threatened to derail the passage of the bill. Congress must pass its appropriations bills or a new continuing resolution by December 11, when the current congressional resolution to fund all federal funded programs expires.</p>
                <p>Negotiations between the House and Senate are underway on a new version of the bill. Although details of the negotiated bill have not yet been released, we understand that it will adhere to the higher spending caps, restore HOME Investment Partnerships Program funding to $900 million, and provide an additional $100 million for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) to restore funding levels to $3 billion.</p>
                <p>Now is the time to contact your representatives in the House and Senate and tell them how important HOME and CDBG are to your your communities. Your advocacy efforts deserve credit but we must remain vigilant throughout the appropriations process.</p>

              <h3>Congress Considers Extending Low Income Housing Tax Credit, New Market Tax Credit</h3>
                <p>The House of Representatives, Senate and White House have begun negotiations on legislation to extend dozens of expired tax provisions, with the goal of passing a tax extenders bill by December 11. One of the main issues they are debating is whether and which tax extenders will be made permanent. Both provisions are critical to low-income families and communities, and have strong bipartisan support. Learn more about how you can support these programs in <a href="#">Enterprise's blog post</a>. Now is the time to urge Congress to make minimum Low-Income Housing Tax Credit rates and the New Market Tax Credit permanent.</p>

              <h3>HUD Adds New Component to Choice Neighborhoods Program</h3>
                <p>HUD is making up to $10 million available to local communities through a new component of its Choice Neighborhoods program. Planning and action grants of up to $2 million will help selected communities create locally driven plans to transform their struggling neighborhoods and implement early improvements. Until now, Choice Neighborhood planning grants could only be used to create a neighborhood transformation plan. Applications must be submitted through www.grants.gov by February 9.</p>

              <h3>Community Development Field Mourns the Passing of Rick Cohen</h3>
                <p>Rick Cohen, the national correspondent for Nonprofit Quarterly and an unflagging advocate for low-income communities and philanthropic accountability, died suddenly on November 17 at age 64. Rick was a great friend and partner to NACEDA, writing NACEDA blogs for years and, most recently, joining NACEDA and its members this past October to lead a discussion on the changing relationship between philanthropy and community development.</p>
                <p>Rick had a long and distinguished career in journalism, philanthropic accountability, housing and community development. He led the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, served as vice president for both LISC and the Enterprise Foundation, and was director of Jersey City's Department of Housing and Community Development. </p>
                <p>"Rick played a vital role at the nexus of community development and philanthropy," reflected NACEDA Executive Director Frank Woodruff. "The community development field has a large, complicated network of organizations, institutions, and individuals that weave together with a shared goal to improve lives. Keeping those actors accountable to that goal was a large part of what Rick saw as his purpose. That included pointed and constructive critiques of government, philanthropy, intermediaries, as well as you and me. His expertise, honesty and humor will be greatly missed."</p>
                <p>Nonprofit Quarterly has set a memorial page for Rick up on their website to leave comments. Scrolling through the comments is like a who's who of community development. Clearly, Rick touched a lot of people.</p>

              <h3>JPMorgan Chase Foundation Invests $5.1 Million To Expand Community Loan Centers In Texas and Indiana </h3>
                <p>The Community Loan Center model provides small, short-term loans through employers to hard-working families, as a market alternative to payday loans. The JPMorgan Chase PRO Neighborhoods award will allow loan centers in several metro areas in Texas to offer more loans, as well as help establish new loan centers in Lafayette and Fort Wayne, Indiana.</p>
                <p>The model has been a focus of NACEDA and its members for a number of years, including at our 2014 Summit and the People & Places Community Conference. It was also featured earlier this year on our  People and Places blog. The model's expansion into Lafayette and Fort Wayne was facilitated by connections made among NACEDA's members in Texas and Indiana. NACEDA is optimistic about the model's introduction in more states in the coming years.</p>

            <h3>Wells Fargo Invests  Million In Metropolitan Consortium of Community Developers</h3>
              <p>Wells Fargo & Company provided a  million Equity Equivalent Investment to Metropolitan Consortium of Community Developers (MCCD) to provide small business loans and technical assistance to emerging entrepreneurs who face challenges in meeting traditional underwriting criteria. MCCD will use the  million to fund its Open to Business program, allowing them to directly fund as many as 80 emerging entrepreneurs.</p>
              <p>MCCD is an association of over 45 Twin Cities nonprofits who share a common mission: to work collectively to build strong and stable communities by leveraging resources for the development of people and places. The organization provides assistance with business plan development, formulating solid projections, and even providing direct loans to put entrepreneurs in a position to ultimately apply for or transition to traditional bank financing. MCCD provides loans to small businesses ranging from ,000 to ,000 to help them start and grow. "Wells Fargo's support of the Open to Business program enables us to have a dramatic effect in the communities we serve," said MCCD Director of Finance Lee Hall. "Each dollar our program lends leverages more than  of private investment and equity, and we cycle these funds multiple times during the investment term to support these small businesses and their communities." </p>

            <h3>NLIHC Crunches Numbers on Mortgage Interest Deduction for Loans Over $500,000</h3>
              <p>The National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) released a report revealing that of nearly 20 million mortgages originated from 2012 to 2014, only five percent were made up of mortgages over $500,000. The report, A Rare Occurrence: The Geography and Race of Mortgages Over $500,000, finds that nationwide only 1.8 percent of black borrowers and 2.4 percent of Hispanic borrowers obtained mortgages larger than $500,000. Given the rarity of mortgages over $500,000, the report addresses fears that lowering the Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID) cap to $500,000 will affect home prices nationwide. In addition, the report finds that reducing the portion of mortgages eligible for a tax break by half would generate  billion over 10 years, which could then be invested into affordable housing.</p>
