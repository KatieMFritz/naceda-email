                                  <p>It’s time to renew your annual NACEDA membership. I’ve attached an invoice with your 2016 dues assessment.</p>

                                  <p>The amount of your dues may be different than in past years because the NACEDA membership voted to change the dues structure in 2015. Also new, you will have the opportunity to claim hardship or contribute a little extra with an additional assessment. If you have any questions, please let us know.</p>
                                  <hr>
                                  <p>On behalf of the NACEDA board and staff, I want to thank you for a tremendous 2015. To celebrate our accomplishments, here’s a list of 16 things that will remind you of the past year – and give you a glimpse into 2016.</p>
                                  <h2>2015 Year in Review</h2>
                                  <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Growing membership:</strong> NACEDA membership grew by a third in 2015 as we welcomed 11 new west coast members. NACEDA now has 44 state and regional community development associations in 28 states and the District of Columbia. Through our members, NACEDA connects with more than 3,500 community-based nonprofits throughout the United States.</li>
                                    <li><strong>People &amp; Places Conference:</strong> NACEDA and its People & Places partners put on the most diverse and inclusive community development conference in a decade. Five hundred practitioners and partners converged on DC to share best practices, recognize our collective strengths, and celebrate our differences.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Chicago member meeting:</strong> Over 50 members and partners gathered in Chicago in early October for our annual membership meeting. With our hosts Housing Action Illinois and the Chicago Rehab Network, we discussed philanthropic trends, emerging leaders in the field, CRA, toured South Side, Chicago, and indulged in some deep dish pizza.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Caucus convenings:</strong> Our smaller and more intimate caucus convenings began adding a new value to being part of the NACEDA network. Last year, our regional caucuses convened in Oakland, CA, Baltimore, MD, and Hartford, CT. We currently have caucuses scheduled in Trenton, NJ and Oakland,CA in 2016 and a couple more in the planning stages.</li>
                                    <li><strong>NEA grant:</strong> NACEDA received its first direct federal investment last summer – a $100,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to embark on a Creative Placemaking Immersion Program that will form strong partnerships between the CED field and the arts. More news on that is coming in 2016.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Growing staff:</strong> NACEDA deeply grew its membership services capacity by hiring Jeremy Brownlee in October. We are excited to have him on board!</li>
                                    <li><strong>Frequent flyer miles.</strong> Staff made its way around the country in 2015. Connections to our members and the broader field are critical to doing our jobs well. 2015 visits included: Hartford, CT; Needham, MA, Baltimore, MD; Seattle, WA; Portland, OR; Los Angeles, CA; Oakland, CA; Chicago, IL; New York City; St. Louis, MO; Charleston, SC; Indianapolis, IN; and East Windsor, NJ.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Recognition of board leadership:</strong> For the first time, the Diane Sterner Award for Community Development Association Leadership recognized a state association's founding board member -- Terri Murray, Executive Director of Neighborhood Renaissance and founding board chair of the Florida Alliance of CDCs.</li>
                                  </ol>
                                  <h2>Things to look forward to in 2016</h2>
                                  <ol start="9">
                                    <li><strong>Cleveland Rocks!</strong> The NACEDA Summit is back in full force heading to Cleveland August 29-31. This year's summit will feature a one-day symposium -- Community Economic Development & the Social Determinants of Health -- made possible by an investment from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Special thanks to the Ohio CDC Association for stepping up to host their colleagues.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Emerging Leader Development Fund:</strong> We received an investment from the PNC Foundation to explore how NACEDA can support emerging leaders in our network to grow in the field and grow their skills to continually improve how they serve their communities and organizations' missions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>New website, you're looking at it!</strong> We have been working diligently on deepening the value and experience you can access via www.naceda.org. Currently, we are in the soft launch phase, which you can find at <a href="https://naceda.memberclicks.net">naceda.memberclicks.net</a>. It's open to all members (after all, that's where you will pay your dues). So let us know what you think and if you find any bugs.</li>
                                    <li><strong>People & Places Collaboration:</strong> NACEDA and its partners are continuing to deepen our activities. Look forward to exciting announcements coming in 2016, including the 2017 date for the next People & Places Conference.</li>
                                    <li><strong>New board leadership:</strong> NACEDA looks forward to growing under some new board leadership in 2016. Paige Carlson-Heim (TD Bank), Matt Hull (Texas Association of CDCs) and Marla Newman (Louisiana Housing Alliance) were elected late last year.</li>
                                    <li><strong>NDC Trainings in the Mid-Atlantic:</strong> Through a partnership among four NACEDA members in the Mid-Atlantic and BB&T Bank, a full Affordable Housing Development Finance professional certification series will kick off in April 2016 in Trenton, NJ. Priority slots for the trainings will go to our four member partners in that region. But opportunities for others are likely. Watch for announcements when we have slots available.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Creative Placemaking Immersion:</strong> We are excited to begin implementation of our Creative Placemaking Immersion for at least three NACEDA members. Our partners at Americans for the Arts have gone above and beyond our expectations during the early stages of this program. Watch for an RFP in the next few months.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Thriving Networks:</strong> We have an opportunity this year to develop a technical assistance program to encourage NACEDA member associations to provide association-oriented technical assistance to peer associations. The potential is exciting. We will ask that you participate in an online needs assessment for your association. Stay tuned.</li>
                                  </ol>
                                  <hr>
                                  <p>We look forward to working together to build prosperity and maximize the power of place.</p>
